  <h3>Hi There🖐</h3>
  <br/>
  I'm a junior Spring Boot Back-end Developer, and my nickname is Neopchi🐠, which is a delicious korean fish and my GF🙆‍♀️ made it and call me Neopchi.
  <br/><br/>
  I believe that a good application can make the world more comfortable than now!<br/>I would want to be a good companion to do this with you guys☺.
  <br/><br/>
  Even though I'm a Spring Boot Developer, but I'm interested in python as a second language, and usually use it when I want to make something interesting such as Data Science and Artificial Intelligence(Although I'm a novice), in addition, a simple API Server(Fast API). Because I believe that I can develop almost everything, which I think of, with python.
