Hi There🖐
<br/><br/>
I'm a junior Spring Boot Back-end Developer, and my nickname is Neopchi🐠, which is a delicious korean fish and my GF🙆‍♀️ made it and call me Neopchi.
<br/><br/>
I believe that a good application can make the world more comfortable than now! I would want to be a good companion to do this with you guys☺.
<br/><br/>
Even though I'm a Spring Boot Developer, but I'm interested in python as a second language, and usually use it when I want to make something interesting such as Data Science and Artificial Intelligence(Although I'm a novice), in addition, a simple API Server(Fast API). Because I believe that I can develop almost everything which I think of with python.
